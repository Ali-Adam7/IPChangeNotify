# IPChangeNotify
Monitor change in external IP and noitfy via Email

This application was made so that a user without a static external IP address will always know the current IP of a network so they could access their database or server from anywhere.

It routinely checks the external IP address of the computer and sends an email via Node-mailer to the user with the new IP address if it changes.
